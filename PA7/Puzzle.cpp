    This method puts (patches) the given puzzle onto the corresponding part
    of the current puzzle object. To which part it will be patched on could
    be determined by just checking the initial row-column indices and the size
    of the puzzle given in the argument. 
    Unlike crop() method, the puzzle given in the argument may not be an exact 
    correspondence of some sub-puzzle. It is ensured that the given argument will
    be located on some sub-space of the current puzzle, yet it may *partially* 
    overlap with some or more sub-puzzles (See the figure in the pdf).
    The patch operation requires deep-copy of the corresponding sub-puzzles
    whereas it requires shallow copy of the corresponding Piece objects.
    
    HINT: You may get benefit from placePiece() method and you may start your
    operation by clearing the corresponding parts of the current puzzle.
